# About

R-CNN, or Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks, represents a groundbreaking approach in object detection that combines region proposals with convolutional neural networks. This method first selects potential object regions (or "proposals") in an image and then uses a CNN to classify each region into different object categories. The main goal of this project is to convert a RCNN into a classification problem. We are trying to convert it to classification to test our sequential transfer learning algorithm where we can transfer weights from various pre-trained model including R-CNN to train our target model.

This repository is still in work in progress and will be updated as we progress through our research.
